# porepy_lab
This repository is intended to exchange ideas related to [PorePy](https://github.com/pmgbergen/porepy). The scripts provided here can to some extent serve as examples for how to use PorePy, however, no guarantees are given that the scripts will be updated as the code evolves (nor that outdated scripts will be deleted, although we  aspire to do so).
